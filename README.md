# Abstract

The dramatically fast evolution of COVID-19 has triggered scientists around theworld to conceive fast effective responses in favor of a better understanding of thisnovel disease. Radiography examination is an available, accessible, and portablealternative screening method that enables rapid triaging. In this sense, deep neuralnets can provide recognition and classification tasks to aid radiologist experts andimprove Chest X-ray (CXR) images analyses for faster medical treatment.Wang’s(2020)work deploys a customized network, a.k.a. COVID-Net, conceived froman automatic network search (AutoML) consisting of a deep-CNN composed ofseveral PEPX modules. This work aims to reproduceWang’s (2020)network inPyTorch without accounting for pre-training on the ImageNet dataset. Furthermore,the challenge of dealing with small data and the duty to provide reasonable accuracyfor medical purposes drives the investigation of deep neural methods to go onvarious strands.  We provide a performance comparison with ResNet50 as weaccount for possible extensions and improvements through generative models.Further additions, such as calibration, GradCAM algorithm, and an interface forsimplified usability were added on the top of results analysis.Keywords:COVID-19, COVID-Net, ResNet, CNNs, GradCAM, calibration, generative networks.
